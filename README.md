Yesod-server-for-GCM
====================

This is a server to comunicate with Android-powered devices through Google Cloud Messaging. 
I developed two programs, a server written in Haskell and an Android application for mobile phones. 
Also, I developed an EDSL to write programs which exchange information with the devices.
For more information you can read explanation.pdf file. (it is in Spanish now, but I will 
replace it for an English version in the future)
